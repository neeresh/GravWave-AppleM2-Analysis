# Introduction

The provided Python script serves as a benchmark test for evaluating the performance of the PyCBC software's pycbc_inspiral module. This benchmark systematically explores the behavior of the module under different configurations, varying parameters such as the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) backend, processing scheme, and FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) threads backend. The script utilizes the pytest framework to run the benchmark, employing the benchmark fixture to measure the execution time of the pycbc_inspiral command for each combination of parameters

# Files Purpose

**test_benchmarking.py**: This file is a benchmark test script written in Python using the pytest framework, designed to assess the performance of the PyCBC software's pycbc_inspiral module under various configurations, providing insights into its execution time and efficiency.

**SMALLER_BANK_FOR_GW150914.hdf**: This file, employed in the inspiral analysis, is a reduced-size bank file.

**COMPRESSED_BANK.hdf**: This file represents the compressed version of the initial bank file, namely, **SMALLER_BANK_FOR_GW150914.hdf**.

# Execution Order

To conduct the test, run the following code snippet:

```
python test_benchmarking.py
```
